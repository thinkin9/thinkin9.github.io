1. control flow
    * With a condition codes which store the characteristics of the recently performed operations
        * CF: Carry flag
        * ZF: Zero flag
        * SF: Sign flag
        * OF: Overflow flag

2. data flow
    * pipelining
    * Overlapping the successive instructions
    * Using conditional jump => Large Overhead if the branch prediction logic does not work well
